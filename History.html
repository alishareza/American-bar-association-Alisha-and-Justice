                    <br>
                    <p1> In Saratoga Springs, New York, on August 21, 1878, 75 attorneys from 20 states and the District of Columbia formed the American Bar Association. The ABA website states that at that time, there was hardly any legal profession as we know it today. Typically, attorneys worked as lone practitioners and received their training through an apprenticeship program. There was no national body to provide a venue for discussion of the increasingly complex issues involved in practicing law, nor was there a national code of ethics.</p1>
                    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/American_Bar_Association_3c_1953_issue_U.S._stamp.jpg/220px-American_Bar_Association_3c_1953_issue_U.S._stamp.jpg" height="200">
                    <p2> Judge Mary Belle Grossman of Cleveland and Judge Mary Florence Lathrop of Denver became the first women to be admitted to the American Bar Association in 1918. The National Lawyers Guild was founded in 1937 as a result of the ABA's discriminatory practices, which excluded all African-American members before 1943. The ABA was eventually integrated after Francis E. Rivers was denied admission in 1943 and some notable members threatened to resign as a result. A new ethical rule that forbids lawyers from using sexist, racist, or patronizing language was implemented by the American Bar Association in 2016. Additionally, the regulation forbids lawyers from discriminating against clients based on age when doing bar association business. These new policy changes and the growth of popularity in the interest group not only promoted justice and the rule of law but also set a modeling role in eliminating bias and enhancing diversity.
                    </p2>
                    <p3>Now, the American Bar Association is a key player in the advancement of state and federal legislation, the reform of the legal system, and the assessment of candidates for federal judicial positions. More than 288,000 people are currently members of the association, including paralegals, law librarians, recent law school graduates, attorneys, and law students. </p3>
