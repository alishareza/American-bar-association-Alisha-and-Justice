                    <h1> <u>What Tactics Does ABA Use?</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p1> The work of the ABA is primarily conducted by several sections and standing and special 
                        committees, each of which is focused on a particular area of practice or issues that are 
                        particularly important to the public and the bar. The House of Delegates and the Board of 
                        Governors, the ABA's governing bodies, receive the resolutions that the various sections 
                        and committees have approved after debating and researching legal and professional 
                        issues. </p1>
                    <p2>ABA's Governmental Affairs Office serves as the communication outlet for the whole association. This office allows for ABA witnesses to testify before congressional committees and other government bodies. The Governmental Affairs Office also submits various letters, position papers, and written statements geared towards aligning issues of Congress to ABA policies. The GAO exercises grassroots lobbying techniques by notifying state and local bar groups about legislative developments that need collective action.</p2>
                    <p3>ABA's goal to ensure all people have access to justice systems is crucial in guaranteeing everyone can receive the help they need no matter their situation. The Center for Global Programs at ABA works with local judiciaries in various countries to aid them in making legal information and services readily available to their citizens. Efforts such as improving the physical accessibility to legal centers have made the biggest difference in advancing access to justice. </p3>
